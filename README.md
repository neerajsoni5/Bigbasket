I have started with base model like regression, then ML algorith like Random Forest and ended with best results coming out from GBM.
I have also tried to use XGB , but not able to complete it because of my other work priorities... But happy that i have atleast started with it....

I have concentrated on below key things to develop model
a) Missing value imputation-- Keep it simple dont go to granular
b)New variable creation - from the data set- Like i have create a variable New store and old store from Outlet Establishment Year.
